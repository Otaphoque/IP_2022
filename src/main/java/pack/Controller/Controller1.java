            - then the calculate button will be clicked(the entire SleFinalCalc
              function will end up in the eventHandler for the button that
              starts the calculations)
            - then the user input will be injected into a matrix from an arraylist
            - after that the calculations will be done(code is already done for that (solves for x,y,z))
            - then the answer should be spit out on a label/maybe hBox? idfk ill figure that out when we come to it
                    -> the form will take on X=
                                             Y=
                                             Z=
                    -> then maybe ill print the matrix + imverse of the matrix? idk we'll get to that
                        when we come to it but for now this is the plan
